### GIT 
* it is a stupid content tracker
* its a key value pair 
* if the commit id is change content will change
### Merge
* it will create two parant
* it will preserve the data
### agent
* first commit from agent (developer1)
### rebase 
* rebase not preserve the history it will rewrite.
* if we select require linerar history -we should use only rebase.

### Squash
* all commits is make into single commit
* squash rebase and rebase both are same 
* better use sqush rebase.
###
* if branch is developed by multiple developer then prefer merge
* if branch is developed by single developer then use rebase
* every one using merge but rebase is have feature in microservices
### branching strategy
* main- log live branch 
feature - short live branch

developer create feature branches once they comple the development they will raise PR and merge/rebase into main branch
### fast-forward merge -->build one in dev and run anyware

### conflict
